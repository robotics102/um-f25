# Part 2: Training Machine Learning Algorithms
{: .no_toc }
Project 4
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

In this part, we will use a Python library called [SciKit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). This library has implementations for multiple machine learning algorithms. We will focus on three of them:

* [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)
* [Linear Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html)
* [Neural Network](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html)

We will use the SciKit Learn implementations for each of these. Your job will be to train the best versions of the K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Network algorithms using Cross Validation. The Linear Classifier will be used as a baseline (your Neural Network must outperform it!).

Open the notebook `Machine Learning with SciKit Learn.ipynb` using the Google Drive link provided, and save a copy in your Drive. The text in the notebook guides you through each task. Places where you need to write code are noted in the comments, with the label `TODO`. Please read through the notebook carefully to make sure you do not miss any important instructions.

The end of this notebook contains a cell which allows you to aave your favorite classification algorithm to a file. You should run it, then download the file for [Part 3](https://robotics102.org/um-f25/project_4/3_tour_guide.html). With your partner, select the best algorithm from both of your notebooks to use.
