## Teams

This project will be completed individually. You will not need a robot until the very end. At that point, we will assign two people per robot.

## Getting Your Code

To get your starter code download the files by clicking [here](https://robotics102.org/um-f25/assets/template_code/p4_notebooks_template.zip) and extracting them, or by running the commands below in your terminal. 

* Navigate to a directory that is not already a git repository using ```cd```. If running ```git status``` outputs ```fatal: ...``` you're not in a git repository.
* Download the files from the website ```wget https://robotics102.org/um-f25/assets/template_code/p4_notebooks_template.zip```.
* Unzip the files ```unzip p4_notebooks_template.zip```.
* Delete the zip archive ```rm p4_notebooks_template.zip```.

To get the starter code for the robot portion of the project download the files by clicking [here](https://robotics102.org/um-f25/assets/template_code/p4_robot_tour_guide_template.zip) and extracting them, or by running the commands below in your terminal.

* Navigate to a directory that is not already a git repository using ```cd```. If running ```git status``` outputs ```fatal: ...``` you're not in a git repository.
* Download the files from the website ```wget https://robotics102.org/um-f25/assets/template_code/p4_robot_tour_guide_template.zip```.
* Unzip the files ```unzip p4_robot_tour_guide_template.zip```.
* Delete the zip archive ```rm p4_robot_tour_guide_template.zip```.

## Setting Up Your Repository

You will want to complete the notebooks on [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by uploading them to your [Google Drive](drive.google.com).

To set up a repository for the robot code, follow [the guide](https://robotics102.org/um-f25/workflows/setting_up_repo.html).
